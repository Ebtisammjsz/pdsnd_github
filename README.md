This repository includes three projects for Udacity programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree. 
 
## Project 1

This project involved investigating a given database of movie rentals, requiring the student to execute SQL queries and develop visual representations to demonstrate the results of these queries.
In the presentation phase, the student was tasked with constructing four slides, each encompassing (a) a compelling question, (b) a corresponding SQL query essential for addressing the question, (c) a relevant visualization generated from the conclusive data of the SQL queries, and (d) a concise summary for each slide.
